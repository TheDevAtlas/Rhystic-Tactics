# Rhystic-Tactics
 A Tabletop Sim For Roleplaying Games Using Webservers, Phones, and Skylanders Portals

# What Is This Project
The goal of this project is to create a roleplaying multiplayer game using web servers and Skylanders portals. Previously I worked on a framework called Vortex Engine that can connect a Skylander portal to Unity. With this framework, I can create my own "Toys to Life" game. In the end, I would like to get high-quality 3d prints of my friend's DND characters, put an RFID tag on the bottom, and be able to play over Discord during the school year, or on a TV table during our breaks. The figures would be a cool way to let us play old fashion style with graphs and battle maps, but also let us have backups of our character sheets. I even want to have a way to export an RFID Dungeons and Dragons character directly to a character sheet for printing.
